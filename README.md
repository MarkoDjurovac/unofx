# UnoFX
Recreation of UNO as a JavaFX project for academic purposes.

# Notes
The project can be considered finished.
After a group discussion, it has been decided that skip and reverse will not be implemented due to lack of multiplayer ( it's player versus bot ) and due to time constraints.

# To-Do's
- ~~Implement customizable games ( UI is there, the backend needs to be finished )~~
- ~~The UX is kinda cumbersome, needs some work.~~
- ~~Sometimes the card-rendering is not doing its job correctly.~~
- Probably some yet undiscovered bugs also need to be taken into consideration.

# How to build
- Set Java 17 as SDK
- Run gradle via terminal or window
